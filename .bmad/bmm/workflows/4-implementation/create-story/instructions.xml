      4. Run `code-review` when complete (auto-marks done)

      **Quality Competition Option:** The `*validate-create-story` command runs the story context through an independent LLM in fresh
      context that will:
      - Systematically re-analyze all source documents
      - Identify any misses, omissions, or improvements
      - Compete to create a more comprehensive story context
